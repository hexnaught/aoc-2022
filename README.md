## Language Choice

Will be attempting to do this in Rust, as it is a language I want to learn but haven't really dove in to much.

A lot of the code here is going to be sub-optimal and not performant... I may go back and optimize things but I am using this as an excuse to explore the Rust language, features, standard library and way of doing things. I may start using TDD and exploring how to structure projects as I go further in this Repo.
